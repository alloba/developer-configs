-- TODO: I'm going to try to migrate off of CoC. 
-- Two main reasons: 
-- - I am using treesitter and lsp already to get some additional features. So it feels like i'm one foot in already. 
-- - It just seems to be the way that the world is going. Online resources tend much more to talk about not CoC. 
-- - I'm bored :P
