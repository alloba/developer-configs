# Developer-Environment-Configs

This repo is a collection of configurations and settings that are meant to be carried between workstations.
Turns out I don't have overly much to cart between locations config wise. :P

A couple of helper scripts and my neovim configuration.

**Specific Setup Instructions**

- NeoVim

  - Copy the the `.config/nvim` folder to whatever your `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory is (usually `~/.config`).
  - Follow instructions in the nvim folder's `README.md`. Pretty much just run packer sync and restart nvim a few times...

- iTerm2: Scripts must be imported via the `Scripts` menu.
  Read each plugin for specific instructions on how to use / detailed configuration
  - iTerm2 puts scripts in `~/.config/iterm2/AppSupport/Scripts/`
