The scripts in this folder are meant to be imported into iTerm2 directly. 
Each script should includes instructions on how to use them.
You may have to assign keyboard shortcuts and the like to get things working properly, so keep it in mind. 

iterm2 wants scripts to be located in this folder: `~/.config/iterm2/AppSupport/Scripts/`
